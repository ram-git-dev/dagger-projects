# Multi-Service Build Pipeline with Dagger

## What is Dagger and Why It Matters

[Dagger](https://dagger.io/) is a modern tool for building pipelines inside lightweight, portable containers. It lets us define and run builds in a clean, consistent environment every time â€” no more "works on my machine" problems. By using Dagger, this project builds only the services that actually changed, saving time and resources.

## What This Project Does

Automatically detects which Go services have changed compared to `origin/main`, then builds only those services inside containerized Go environments using Dagger. Built binaries are exported locally for use or deployment.

## Setup
1. Install Go (v1.20+)
2. Clone this repo and navigate to it
3. Ensure Dagger is installed and running (see [Dagger docs](https://dagger.io)

## How to Run Locally
From the repo root, run:

go run main.go

This will:

    Detect changed services using git diff against origin/main

    Build those services inside containerized Go environments

    Export built binaries to ./{service}-built

GitHub Actions CI

    Runs on pushes to feature branches (excluding main)

    Detects changed services and builds them

    Ensures only updated services are built and tested before merging to main

How Changed Services Are Detected

    Uses git diff --name-only origin/main...

    Looks for changes under services/{serviceName}/

    Builds only services with detected changes

Adding New Services

    Add your service under services/{new-service}

    Make sure it contains a valid Go project that builds with go build

Troubleshooting

    Ensure your git remote is up to date (run git fetch origin)

    Confirm Dagger daemon is running (dagger daemon or similar)

    Check logs for build failures and missing dependencies
